# Grav(ity)Well

A BabylonJS powered game that models a star system, some planets, and the player's ship using just one simple equation:  
`F = G * (m1*m2) / r^2`

Control the ship using A/D or the Left/Right arrow keys. Apply thrust in the current direction the ship is facing by pressing W or the Up arrow.

Don't crash into anything!
